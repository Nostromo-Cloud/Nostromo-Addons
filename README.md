## If you want to register your addons, it's easy.

* **(1)** Create an issue with a direct link from your addons
* **(2)** Your addons must contain the addons.yml file with this valid instruction 
* **(3)** Your addons must not be obfuscated under any circumstances. 
* **(4)** If all and good a moderator or myself will validate this addons on the repo

## Security restriction 

* **(1)** You should not use reflection (ASM, etc) in your addons.
* **(2)** Do not use a garbage library
